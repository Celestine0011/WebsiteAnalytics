# **WebsiteAnalytics**

Web analytics is the process of analyzing the behavior of visitors to a website. This involves tracking, reviewing and reporting data to measure web activity, which includes the use of a website and its components, such as webpages, images and videos.

Data collected through web analytics may include traffic sources, referring sites, page views, paths taken and conversion rates. The compiled data often forms a part of customer relationship management analytics (CRM analytics) to facilitate and streamline better business decisions.

The objective of web analytics is to serve as a business metric for promoting specific products to the customers who are most likely to buy them and to determine which products a specific customer is most likely to purchase. This can help improve the ratio of revenue to marketing costs.

Using DAX functions, I was able to identify the visit metrics, site metrics, website performance, bounce rate and other significant customer behavioural metrics.
